INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the user question to understand what attributes/characteristics are being searched for
2. Examine each user in the context and determine if they match the search criteria
3. For matching users, extract and return their complete information
4. Be inclusive - if a user partially matches or could potentially match, include them

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- If you find matching users: Return their full details exactly as provided, maintaining the original format
- If no users match: Respond with exactly "NO_MATCHES_FOUND"
- If uncertain about a match: Include the user with a note about why they might match"""

4. If multiple users match, group them logically
5. If no users match, explain what was searched for and suggest alternatives"""

# The problems with No Grounding approach are:
#   - If we load whole users as context in one request to LLM we will hit context window
#   - Huge token usage == Higher price per request
#   - Added + one chain in flow where original user data can be changed by LLM (before final generation)
# User Question -> Get all users -> ‼️parallel search of possible candidates‼️ -> probably changed original context -> final generation
